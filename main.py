Bob the builder makes making account checkers even easier
I made this because some niggers can't code for shit (like myself)
So now if you are one of those niggers then congrats you can build a account checker


Note: This is still in development so there might be a few bugs or something

By the way this doesn't work on shit like fortnite, valorant this is for
sites with basic login sec

This means that you will not be able to make a fucking fortnite checker 
Maybe in the future I will make this shit better

But if you liked this tool consider leaving a star üòÅ goodbye nigger!
