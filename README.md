# BobTheBuilder Version 1.0
Makes making account checkers easier

```
Bob the builder makes making account checkers even easier
I made this because some niggers can't code for shit (like myself)
So now if you are one of those niggers then congrats you can build a account checker

By the way this doesn't work on shit like fortnite, valorant this is for
sites with basic login sec

This means that you will not be able to make a fucking fortnite checker 
Maybe in the future I will make this shit better

But if you liked this tool consider leaving a star üòÅ goodbye nigger!
```

```Note: This is still in development so there might be a few bugs or something```

# Setup

```
1. Have Python Installed
2. Open setup.bat | This will install some libs
3. Have 1 or 2 braincells (All jokes aside you need some knowdlege on how apis work)
4. Run main.py!
```

# Help

Alright so if you read the whole paragraph I wrote, you can NOT make checker's for websites that have good login security so the payload should only have the username and password field. 
Yes very shitty but In the Future I will make this tool better I made this in like less than 4 hours so I didn't actually add much stuff next update I'll add more features.
